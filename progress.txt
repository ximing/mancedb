## Codebase Patterns
- Electron auto-updater is already configured in `apps/client/src/main/updater.ts` with `electron-updater`
- Menu items for "Check for Updates" already exist in `apps/client/src/main/menu.ts`
- Build order: dto → lancedb-core → web → client (must respect workspace dependencies)
- Use `pnpm --filter @mancedb/<package>` to run commands in specific packages
- Electron builder config is in `apps/client/electron-builder.yml` (not json)
- macOS dual architecture requires separate jobs: `macos-13` for x64, `macos-latest` for arm64
- GitHub Actions artifacts should use `if-no-files-found: warn` for platform-specific builds

## 2026-02-17 - US-001 through US-006
- Created comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/build-electron.yml`
- Configured 4 parallel build jobs: macOS x64 (macos-13), macOS arm64 (macos-latest), Windows, Linux
- Set up pnpm caching and Node.js 20 environment
- Implemented proper build order: packages → web → platform-specific client builds
- Added quality checks job (typecheck + lint) that runs before platform builds
- Configured automatic GitHub Release creation on tag push (v*)
- Release draft mode for alpha/beta/rc tags, auto-generated release notes
- Added build status badge to README.md
- Verified auto-updater already integrated (electron-updater in updater.ts)
- Verified "Check for Updates" menu item already exists in Help menu
- Files changed:
  - `.github/workflows/build-electron.yml` (new)
  - `README.md` (added badge)
- Typecheck: Passed
- Lint: Passed
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The existing `build-client.yml` is simpler but doesn't separate macOS architectures
  - electron-builder.yml already has publish config for GitHub releases
  - Use `macos-13` runner for Intel builds as `macos-latest` is now Apple Silicon
  - Artifacts need unique names per job to avoid collisions
  - The `merge-multiple: true` option simplifies downloading all artifacts for release
