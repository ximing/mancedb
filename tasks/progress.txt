## Codebase Patterns
- Use `experimentalDecorators: true` in tsconfig for @rabjs/react decorators to work
- Service class from @rabjs/react is already observable - no need for @Action decorator on methods
- All Service methods are automatically actions (batch updates) unless marked with @SyncAction
- Keep auth.service.ts and theme.service.ts as they are needed for the auth flow
- Use different icon/color combinations for data types: string (green), number (blue), boolean (purple), vector (orange), date (cyan), binary (gray)
- LanceDB Arrow types need special parsing - fixed_size_list contains vector dimensions
- Table schema is fetched via GET /api/v1/tables/:name/schema endpoint

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- The @rabjs/react framework uses experimental decorators - must enable in tsconfig
- Service class from rabjs is already observable, methods are automatically actions
- When deleting files, be careful not to delete services that are still needed (auth, theme)
- The project uses pnpm workspaces with turbo for build orchestration
- Server build outputs to dist/, web build outputs to server/public/

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- LanceDB table.schema() is an async method that returns Promise<Schema>
- Arrow schema fields have name, type (with toString()), and nullable properties
- fixed_size_list types contain vector information: fixed_size_list<item_type, dimension>
- Use regex to extract vector dimension from type string: /fixed_size_list<([^,]+),\s*(\d+)>/
- Table size estimation is needed since LanceDB doesn't provide direct size API
- Different Arrow types need different byte size estimates for size calculation
---

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Use getTypeStyle() helper to get icon and color classes for different data types
- Vector columns show dimension count as a badge in the properties column
- The TableSchemaView component takes tableName as a prop and loads schema on mount
- DatabaseContent acts as a router within the database view - shows browser when no table selected, schema when table selected
- formatBytes() helper converts bytes to human-readable format (B, KB, MB, GB, TB)
---

## 2026-02-16 - US-012 Complete
- Implemented table data browse backend API with pagination support

- All builds pass (typecheck and lint)

**Files changed:**
- apps/server/src/services/table.service.ts

- Vector columns are detected by checking if value is array/typed array with length > 10
- Binary data (Uint8Array/Buffer) should be truncated for display
- Date objects are converted to ISO strings for JSON serialization
- Maximum page size is capped at 1000 to prevent memory issues
---

## 2026-02-16 - US-013 Complete
- Created table-data.ts API for fetching paginated table data from GET /api/v1/tables/:name/data

- apps/web/src/services/database.service.ts
- apps/web/src/pages/database/components/table-data-view.tsx (new)
- apps/web/src/pages/database/components/database-content.tsx

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- The table data API uses the same request utility as other APIs (request.get with URLSearchParams)
- Vector detection in frontend relies on string format "[N-dim vector]" from backend
- Row numbers are calculated from (page - 1) * pageSize + rowIndex + 1
- Pagination UI shows ellipsis (...) when there are many pages
- Use getTypeStyle() helper from table-schema.tsx for consistent type display
- The JSON detail modal shows full row data including truncated vectors
- Tab switching triggers data load when switching to Data tab

- apps/web/src/api/table-data.ts
- apps/web/src/services/database.service.ts
- apps/web/src/pages/database/components/table-data-view.tsx

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- LanceDB Query doesn't have countRows() - must use toArray().length for filtered counts
- Filter conditions are passed as URL-encoded JSON in query parameters
- LanceDB WHERE clause uses SQL-like syntax with LIKE for text matching
- Always escape single quotes in filter values to prevent SQL injection
- For large datasets, counting filtered results by loading all rows may be inefficient

**Files changed:**
- apps/server/src/services/query.service.ts (new)
- apps/server/src/controllers/v1/query.controller.ts (new)
- apps/server/src/controllers/index.ts

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- Use LanceDbService injected via TypeDI to access admin database tables
- Query history recording uses the same LanceDbService.openTable('query_history') pattern
- SQL parsing uses regex to extract FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY, and LIMIT clauses
- Only SELECT queries are allowed for security (read-only access)
- Query execution time is measured using Date.now() before and after query
- Failed queries are also recorded to history with error message
